You've pasted a React-based JSX + Tailwind CSS + config file fragment that mixes:

1. Imports and component registration


2. Tailwind + CSS variable declarations


3. A functional component stub (possibly a duplicate Dashboard)

🔍 Code Review & Analysis Breakdown


---

🔸 1. Duplicate Component Definition

import Dashboard from "@/pages/Dashboard";
// ...
export default function Dashboard() {

❌ This will cause a conflict because you're importing a component named Dashboard and also defining it locally.

Fix: Rename one of the two. If the file is meant to be the Dashboard, do not import it. Otherwise, change the export default function to another component name.



---

🔸 2. Duplicate Imports

import { ProphecyMatches } from '@/components/ProphecyMatches';
import ProphecyMatches from "@/pages/ProphecyMatches";

import { NewsFeed } from '@/components/NewsFeed';
import NewsFeed from "@/pages/NewsFeed";

❌ You're importing the same-named component from two places — components and pages.

This leads to name collision and ambiguous component usage.

Fix: Either rename imports (ProphecyMatchesComponent, ProphecyMatchesPage) or avoid importing both if not used.



---

🔸 3. ThemeProvider Imported Twice

import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/ThemeProvider";
...
import { ThemeProvider } from "@/components/ThemeProvider";

❌ Duplicate import – unnecessary.

✅ Fix: Remove one of them.



---

🔸 4. Unfinished Component Logic

export default function Dashboard() {
  const [selectedTradition, setSelectedTradition] = useState<Tradition>('christian');
  const [premiumModalOpen, setPremiumModalOpen] = useState(false);
  const [briefingModalOpen, setBriefingModalOpen] = useState(false);
  const [dailyBriefing, setDailyBriefing] = useState('');
  const { toast } = useToast();

✅ State setup looks good.

⚠️ But: There is no return statement or JSX, so the component is incomplete.



---

🔸 5. Global Styles and Variables (Tailwind + Custom CSS)

@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
  --background: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
  ...
  --prophecy-amber: hsl(45, 100%, 64%);
}

✅ Great use of Tailwind + custom color variables.

👍 Smart idea to define theme-specific variables like --prophecy-amber, --conflict-red, etc.

You might want to organize them under comment blocks like:


/* === UI Theme Variables === */
/* === End Times Tracker Custom Colors === */

🧠 Suggested Fixes & Next Steps

1. ✅ Remove duplicate imports


2. ✅ Fix the naming conflict on Dashboard


3. ✅ Complete the component JSX


4. ✅ Decide whether you're building a full app layout or a module


5. ✅ Ensure global styles (Tailwind and CSS Vars) are in a separate file like globals.css or theme.css if not already

🧩 Possible File Split Recommendations

File	Suggested Contents

App.jsx or MainRouter.jsx	All route declarations using <Switch> and <Route>
Dashboard.jsx	The default export Dashboard component JSX
theme.css	Tailwind @tailwind + :root custom vars
queryClient.ts	The Query Client setup

✅ Final Comment

Your structure shows vision and ambition — you're building something major like a global crisis tracker with spiritual/prophetic tools. But a few duplicate imports and incomplete setup are causing potential bugs.

Let me know if you'd like:

A cleaned-up version of this file
